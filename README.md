# Gaia Plastics Project
This README provides a brief project description and setup information. Please go to our Wiki (https://github.com/waterhog/gaia_plastics/wiki) if you want more in-depth information about the project and how to set up a device.

## Introduction
The Gaia Plastics Project is an IoT project for counting plastic objects floating on the surface of rivers. The project uses a simple hardware setup including a camera, and a computer vision model to detect plastics objects. Every 15 minutes, a plastic count for that period is sent from the device to the cloud. This data can be queried from a mobile phone. In the future, we plan to add a front-end that will use a map to display near-real-time plastic counts from all devices.

**Goal of the project**

The goal of the project is to provide near-real-time data about plastics in rivers. We know that plastic washed into the ocean from rivers is a major source of ocean plastic; **around 90% of the plastic in the ocean come from only 9 or 10 major rivers** **citation needed**. Despite this, **there is a severe lack of data about plastics in rivers**. Without data, it is difficult to take action. We hope this data can be used to organize cleanups, help businesses and local government agencies to handle their waste, and even help drive regulation.
